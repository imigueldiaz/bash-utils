# prepare-docker

## Important Note

This project is archived and no longer maintained. The last update was around April 25, 2020. The Docker installation process may have changed significantly in the last 3 years, so this script is likely outdated. 

## Original Project Description

prepare-docker was a small Bash script to install Docker and Docker Compose on a new machine or VM.

It aimed to automate the steps required to:

- Install prerequisite packages
- Add the Docker repository 
- Install Docker
- Install Docker Compose

By running this script, you could quickly prepare a new Linux environment with Docker ready to go.

At the time, it was useful for rapidly setting up Docker on things like CI servers, cloud VMs, and local dev environments.

## Project Archived

As this script has not been updated since 2020, it is being archived. The Docker installation process changes over time so this is likely no longer accurate.

Rather than use an outdated script, it is recommended to follow Docker's official installation instructions for your operating system:

- [Docker Engine installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
